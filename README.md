My First Attempt at Building a Book Bot: A Step-by-Step Guide

This was my first attempt at creating a book bot, and it turned out to be a guided process. While the main wrapper was initially difficult to understand, the breakdown of tasks made it easier to follow. With the help of Boot.dev, I was able to structure the bot as follows:

Wrote a function to fetch the number of words in the text.
Retrieved the count of each character in the text.
Sorted each character using the items method to identify characters and count their occurrences.
Added a function to handle edge cases (e.g., if a character is a number) by using the isalpha method to determine how the program should execute.
Most of the additional functions were guided by lessons from Boot.dev.

At line 49 and below, thereâ€™s a mini program that performs the same operations but accepts user input instead of using the fixed books/frankenstein.txt path.
